# Olympic-Data-Engineering-with-Azure
In this project, I utilized Azure's powerful data engineering tools to analyze and derive insights from Olympic data. The project involved the following key steps:

Azure Resource Setup:

Created an Azure resource group and Data Lake Storage to store Olympic data.
Migrated CSV files containing Olympic data from local storage to Azure Data Lake (ADL).
Data Integration and Preparation:

Connected Azure Synapse Analytics to the ADL storage and created an Olympic database.
Staged the Olympic database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for further analysis.
Configured credentials and SAS tokens for secure data access and manipulation.
Data Analysis:

Conducted comprehensive SQL queries to explore and analyze the Olympic data.
Key analyses included:
Counting and listing Olympic games held.
Analyzing participating nations and sports over the years.
Identifying standout athletes and nations in terms of medal counts.
Exploring gender ratios among athletes.
Focusing on India's performance in specific sports like Hockey.
